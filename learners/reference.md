* For questions after the workshop:
  - If you have questions about the analysis of the results or the statistics behind
machine learning models, you can reach out to [PSTAT's DataLab](https://datascience.ucsb.edu/consulting)
  - For questions about your project or specific questions on your code, you can email 
the Library's DREAM Lab [dreamlab@library.ucsb.edu](mailto:dreamlab@library.ucsb.edu)

* Depending on the task of your project, you don't have to spend time training ML models from scratch!
If your project involves text, images, or audio, you'll probably find a model ready to be used on
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models)

* For continued self-paced learning, we recommend:
  - This lesson is [part 1 of 4](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/machine-learning-novice-python?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction-to-machine-learning-in-python) from a curriculum on The Carpentries Incubator. The other lessons are
    - Introduction to Tree Models in Python ([Lesson materials](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-trees-python/))
    - Introduction to artificial neural networks in Python ([Lesson materials](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-neural-python/))
    - Responsible machine learning in Python ([Lesson materials](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-responsible-python/))
    
  - Google's [Intro to ML concepts](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/intro-to-ml) and [Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)

* Online asynchronous courses we've enjoyed and you can audit for free:
  - [StanfordOnline: Statistical Learning with R](https://www.edx.org/learn/statistics/stanford-university-statistical-learning)
  - [MITx: Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning](https://www.edx.org/learn/data-analysis/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-data-analysis-statistical-modeling-and-computation-in-applications)

* Other Python resources:
  - [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/)
  - [Scalable and Computationally Reproducible Approaches to Arctic Research](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2024-03-arctic/)
